**Multimodel Learning**

Designing a multimodal machine learning model for the GLAMI-1M dataset involves integrating image and textual data to classify fashion products into 191 categories. Below is a structured approach encompassing data preprocessing, model development, training, testing, and evaluation.

1. Data Loading and Exploration

The GLAMI-1M dataset comprises over 1.1 million records, each containing:

Image: A visual representation of the product.
Textual Data: Product name and description in one of 13 languages.
Categorical Label: One of 191 product categories.
To access and explore the dataset:

Download the Dataset: Follow the instructions provided in the GLAMI-1M GitHub repository to obtain the dataset.
Explore the Data: Utilize the dataset_statistics_overview.ipynb notebook available in the repository to gain insights into the dataset's structure and distribution.
2. Data Preprocessing

Effective preprocessing is crucial for handling multimodal data:

Textual Data Processing:

Tokenization: Convert text into tokens.
Padding: Ensure uniform input length.
Embedding: Map tokens to dense vectors.
Image Data Processing:

Resizing: Adjust images to a consistent size (e.g., 224x224 pixels).
Normalization: Scale pixel values to [0, 1].
Augmentation: Apply transformations like rotation and flipping to enhance model robustness.
Categorical Labels:

Encoding: Convert category labels into one-hot encoded vectors.
3. Model Building

Develop a model that processes both images and text:

Image Subnetwork:

Utilize a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) like EfficientNetB0.
Remove the top layer to extract feature representations.
Text Subnetwork:

Implement an embedding layer followed by an LSTM or GRU to capture textual features.
Fusion and Classification:

Concatenate outputs from both subnetworks.
Add fully connected layers leading to a softmax output for classification.
